# Stickies

This is a simple sticker app.

## How to contribute stickers!

If you want to submit new stickers, create a 300x300 .png image with a transparent background.  That will be the sticker.  You can then submit a Pull Request to this repo.  We will then review it and possibly add it to the sticker panel.
